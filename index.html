      <h1>Event Tracker App</h1>
      
      <h5>From here you can create an account with sign up or log in to an existing one.</h5>
      <p>The purpose of the Event Tracker App is for student, staff, and faculty to discover events, <br>
        register, confirm their attedance, and track their progress towards awards. 
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of accounts that a user can have. Either an administrative account or a main user account. <br>
        Only administrators are able to create, modify, and delete events. They are also able to add or remove users from events as needed. <br>
        Students, staff, and faculty that are not adminstrators of the Event Tracker app are able to modify their accounts as needed and <br>
        see their future and past events.</p>
        <p>Currently the app allows for main users to check-in or verify their attendance via an event passcode that is provided live at the event. <br>
        This is insecure and could be subject to sharing codes so in the future, it is desired to enable QR technology for check-in purposes.</p>
